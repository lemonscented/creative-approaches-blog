## Bad Writer
by Christian Jimenez

I have never taken a creative writing course or have really written creatively in my life. I recall writing short stories in grade school, but nothing that was truly read for its content and creativity. However, when reading the first section of the article, I found myself surprised at the things Ahmad claimed was bad writing. The opening sentences he considered uninspired, I found normal. However, when he elaborated on why they were bad, it became painfully obvious on why they were. I thought the phrase, “an illusion of compassion that really wasn’t there,” gave extra detail to the story and added something of value. But when Ahmad revealed that it actually added nothing, it became clear to me that I viewed writing all wrong. It’s not about trying to fill words to sound sophisticated, it’s about telling a story without any clutter.

Furthermore, the Western Sydney Writers’ Group follows ideals, I truly believe in and wish I could experience. I believe most people cannot separate themselves from their work and take true criticism from an audience. In my opinion, the brash and blunt method of delivering feedback provides the most benefit for the recipient, even if it may offend the creator. While I cannot say I would not get offended and react with hostility, I try to follow this line of thinking to help improve my craft, whatever it may be. Similarly, I find myself using the defensive technique Ahmad describes like,  “that’s just how I do things” or “<insert professional> does it this way, too.” Hopefully I can learn to be more conscious of these and take criticism better.

Finally, I found the genre advice to be the most helpful. Researching a topic is something that would never cross my mind when trying to write something creative. I thought most people would have a brilliant idea and write about it from their heart. However, I find it interesting that actually understanding more about your genre, even if it’s fake, can help create something interesting and enjoyable.
