## Critique of Prison Maps
by Christian Jimenez

The Prison Map, created by Josh Begley, tries to visualize mass incarceration in the United States of America. The piece tries to overwhelm the viewer by presenting hundreds of google satellite images of prisons all around the states. Most likely trying to visualize why the United States is the prison capital of the world and how we have the most prisoners per capita. The way Begley decides to overwhelm the display with the images really helps the idea that there are a numerous amount prisons in the United State, and helps the viewer understand the layouts of the prisons. However, while the number of prisons is impressive, the piece fails to really appeal to me. The piece itself lacks an emotional element allowing me to care about what the artist is doing and understand what they want to convey.

The piece’s presentation style fails to get an emotional reaction out of me and make me care about what the piece is trying to say. Each individual prison’s satellite image gives me not sense of scale when it comes to the prison. The only way to size the prison is by comparing it to other prisons. The idea that these prisons are packed with prisons gets lost by this by this general image. Similarly, the grid system of displaying the prisons does not help catch my interest. The images look so similar to each other that scrolling through them makes me feel more bored and tired than stunned. I get the idea is to present as many prisons as possible, but the grid system feels uninspired and does not leave me wanting more. This piece could have been more interesting by adding some interactivity or doing more artistic styling of the prisons to give the view something to do other than simply scroll. Also, the piece could have more back bone to it. The piece presents itself as a gallery of images, but these images themselves fail to convey a narrative to the viewer. A deeper meaning or connection between the images could do the piece some justice. Overall, the piece fails to really stand out to me and empathize with the artist and his intentions.
