## Data
by Christian Jimenez


First off, I want to start by saying that I don’t believe all data is interpreted. Data is something measured that we care about. While caring about it is subjective, the fact that someone have collected data on a subject does not make it interpreted. Dataset help tells us things we want to know, or sometimes don’t want to know. The data collected tells the user about something in the world that has happened. It’s as soon as the user think about the data, it becomes subjective. However, I am not saying that all datasets are correct. Some dataset can be corrupted from the start by focusing on the answer rather than on the discovery, similar to confirmation bias. Data can become highly subjective when you are trying to satisfy an argument or belief. The data collect already has an idea of what they want to get out of their data and can skew what they may find. Data can be found neutrally if it is collected for the sake of curiosity, or for the sake of having data. Data also can be trusted if it is the most data you can collect. If nothing is left out during the collection process, it can be considered true. While this may be difficult, it is not impossible. Comparing data is another way to tell its legitimacy. If you compare data to other similar data sets not collected by the same people, it is easier to discover whether or not the data should be trusted or discarded. On a differing note, most of this talk on dataset and objectivity seems to be very post-modern. I personally don’t believe in post modernism because I believe it takes away from the original purpose of things. Instead of building things up, much is just broken down into discussion topics where people end up battling the semantics of things. This is why I believe data can be just simply data. There are true things in the world and measuring them does not make them any less true.
