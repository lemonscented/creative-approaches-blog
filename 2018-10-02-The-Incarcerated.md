## The Incarcerated
by Christian Jimenez


The United States has the highest incarceration rate per capita in the world. With 724 people per 100,000, we house 22% of the world’s prison population. Josh Begley tried to represent this problem by displaying what prison geography looks likes, as seen below. His plan was to overwhelm the viewer with the sheer amount of prisons in the United States to make his point and understand what it means to have thousands of people in one place.

While the number of prisons displayed is amazing, it failed to make me care about the issues at hand. The biggest issue with me was that it was missing something important, the human element. When it comes to an issue like this, understanding that people are in these prisons is the most important part.

So instead of what does the prison system look like, who are the ones in it?

For this project, I wanted to keep Josh Begley’s style by sticking to the grid system and overwhelming the viewer with images. I believe this presentation style is especially useful in this problem, but it needs more than just satellite images. Instead of using the images of the prisons, I wanted to use mugshots of people in the criminal justice system. I believe this adds a good amount of the human element I needed in this project. While it does not tell the stories of those incarcerated, it can at least give the viewer a sense of the people in prison instead an empty building.

While mugshots are in the public record, finding an easily scrapable source was a challenge. The way I ended up collecting my data was through Mugshots.com. This website contains a large database of mugshots that can be easily accessed by the public. The database was kept up to date by the curators of the mugshots and removed anyone that was not convicted of a crime. I used an online image scraper to scrape the sight and gathered mugshot. While the criminal justice system has millions of mugshots, due to the time constraints and resource constraints of this project I was only to gather around 1500. These 1500 mugshots are all gathered from the counties around Olin College of Engineering.

While the number of mugshots I collect is nowhere near the amount of people in the criminal justice system, hopefully it can still do its purpose in bringing a face to the people inside.
