## The Internet
by Christian Jimenez

I enjoyed reading Julian Oliver’s experience with telecommunication’s physical element, however, overall i failed to see the point he was making. I’ve never been scared that my cell phone was giving me cancer and I have seen stealth architecture my entire life. While his sentiment was interesting, especially about the 1 phone line in New Zealand, it failed to really make me feel for it.

First, I believe Maciej Ceglowski's piece was most likely a powerpoint presentation, but displaying this way for some reason made me like it even more. Something about it just speaks to me. Overall though, I found the piece interesting and aligning with my views. Relating the internet with the highway system is a great way to describe how the internet has/ or is changing our lives. Similarly, the points Ceglowski made throughout the piece basically put my thoughts into a presentation. To start off, I am very against data collection. I believe it is trading short term convenience for long term trouble. Whether it's the government or private business, no one agency should be in control of the amount of personal data. This presentation brought the pink files to my attention. This thing that has already happened is the culmination of my fears in data collect. While I find myself to be a “cookie-cutter” male, I fear agency may use personal data, like sexual orientation, against the group in order to discriminate or harm them. Ceglowski also talks about how the internet gives more power to advertisers and with this, the desire for businesses to sell data. It really annoys me when i download a stupid iPhone game to play and it asks for me to share all my data with it. My data has nothing to do with me playing this game, but since my data is so valuable, why not try to take it. I believe this kind of business plan is a cancer on society and is slowing draining it. If the tide keeps going this way, the only things that will be created are things that can trick humans into freely giving their data away. Overall, big data is a huge threat to american lifestyle and something needs to change in order to preserve what freedom we have left.
