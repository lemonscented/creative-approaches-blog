One of my largest concerns with the coming age of automation has to do with our economic structure. I believe the US is extremely underprepared for the wave of automation that is about to hit. In the near future, automation will remove hundreds of thousands of jobs from the market. Any cashier or service representative will be taken by a machine and many food related stores like McDonalds or grocery stores have already adopted machines. Self driving cars will also take more jobs from the people. With these jobs gone and nothing to replace them, all of these people will be unable to support themselves and their families. The universal basic income comes up when discussing this topic, however, I don’t believe it will be enough of an economical change to save the US. Overall, automation is coming and cannot be stop, but it’s not too late to change society to help us grow as humans.
